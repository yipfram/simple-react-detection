This is the original repo, I changed it to Typescript
https://github.com/piyush-eon/nextjs-ai-object-detection/blob/master/components/object-detection.js

## Next step?
Next step would be to connect this with my Minio instance and Mongodb via Prisma to make facial recognition with database connection.
Still have to figure out how to route such important traffic to DB in realtime... 

# How to run the code?
You must have [⭐Nodejs⭐](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

run ``npm install`` to install the packages 
then ``npm run dev``

default connection is [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000
